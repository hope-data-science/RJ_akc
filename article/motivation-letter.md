Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "akc: A Tidy Framework for Automatic Knowledge Classification in R" for publication in the R Journal. This is a resubmission, the former article ID is [RJournal 2021-71]. 

The manuscript introduces the new package called `akc` which provides a tidy framework for automatic knowledge classification and visualization. It introduces the framework under the big picture of text mining and network analysis. The features of the package are discussed in detail. Specific examples are given to guide the potential users and developers to participate in open science.

In the revision, we have: 1) used figures with higher resolutions; 2) designed a more simple and clear example; 3) organized codes in shorter blocks; 4) carried out a reproducible benchmark for algorithm selection and make a new package release; 5) removed the first paragraph in Introduction so as to make the motivation clearer; 6) improve the language expressions; 7) applied `rjtools` to format the article. 

We hope our revised manuscript is suitable for publication in the R Journal. Thank you.
